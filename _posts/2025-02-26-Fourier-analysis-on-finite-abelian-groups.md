title: Fourier analysis on finite abelian groups
---

Let $V$ the vector space of all complex-valued functions defined on $\mathbb{Z}_N=\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$. Obviously, for each $n\in\mathbb{Z}_N$, the function $f_n(k)=w^{nk}$ ($w=e^{2\pi i/N}$) is a non-vanishing homomorphism from $\mathbb{Z}_N$ to $\mathbb{C}$, and they altogether serve as an orthogonal basis of $V$. Observing that $f_n$s form a group which is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_N$, we want to extend this for general finite abelian group.
