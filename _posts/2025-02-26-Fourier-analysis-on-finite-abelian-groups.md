title: Fourier analysis on finite abelian groups
---

First, consider the space $\mathcal{Z}_N=Z/NZ$ and the vector space $V$ of all complex-valued functions defined on $\mathcal{Z}_N$. The goal is constructing a good basis for $V$.
In a viewpoint of Fourier analysis, it is reasonable to think following functions: $f_n(k)=w^{nk}$ ($w=e^{2\pi/N}$).
